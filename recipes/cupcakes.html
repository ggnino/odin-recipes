    <h3>Deliciously baked vegan cupcakes, topped with white frosting and a dash of yellow sprinkles.</h3>

    <p>These vegan cupcakes taste amazing and are quick to make! You can play around and substitute different kinds of milk, oils, and extracts; I've used my favorites in the recipe, but just about any will work. Unfortunately, this recipe doesn't rise well as a cake, but cupcakes are more fun anyway! These are great with a simple frosting of cocoa powder, powdered sugar, and orange juice.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups almond milk</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ cup coconut oil, warmed until liquid</li>
        <li>1 ¼ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 12-cup muffin pans or line with 18 paper baking cups</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Pour apple cider vinegar into a 2-cup measuring cup. Fill with almond milk to make 1 1/2 cups. Let stand until curdled, about 5 minutes. </p></li>
        <li><p>Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk together almond milk mixture, coconut oil, and vanilla in a separate bowl. Pour wet ingredients into dry ingredients and stir just until blended. Spoon batter evenly into the prepared cups. </p></li>
        <li><p>Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool in the pan set over a wire rack. </p></li>

    </ol>
