        <h3>Delicious vegan vanilla cake covered in all white frosting topped with a mix of berries and served on a dish with berries.</h3>

        <p>This is a dense, yet somewhat spongy basic vegan cake. It can be topped with a basic vegan chocolate or vegan vanilla buttercream frosting. A nice, easy, basic, homemade favorite that doesn't taste like a box mix AND can be used as a tasty vegan birthday cake! Cool completely before topping with your favorite vegan buttercream frosting.</p>
